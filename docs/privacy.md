# Privacy Policy for Marginalia

Last updated: February 14, 2026

## Overview

Marginalia is a browser extension designed to help users create and manage personal notes associated with specifically requested webpages, domains, or globally. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy details how your data is handled.

**Key Point:** Marginalia operates entirely offline. It does not collect, transmit, or sell your personal data. All notes are stored locally on your device.

## Information We Collect

Marginalia does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal identification information (PII).

- **No User Account:** You do not need to create an account to use the extension.
- **No Analytics:** We do not track your usage or collect behavioral data.
- **No Remote Servers:** We do not have access to any data you enter into the extension.

## How Information Is Used

The information you input (your notes) is used solely for the purpose of displaying it back to you within the extension's interface.

- **Notes:** Text content you create is stored to allow you to view and edit it later.
- **Context:** The extension reads the URL of the active tab solely to determine which note to display (e.g., matching a note to a specific page or website). This URL is processed locally and is never transmitted to us or any third party.

## Data Storage

All data generated by Marginalia is stored locally on your computer using the browser's built-in storage capabilities (e.g., WebExtension `storage.local` API).

- **Location:** Your notes exist only within your browser profile on your device.
- **Security:** Data is sandboxed by the browser's security model.
- **Sync:** Meaningful data is not synced to the cloud by Marginalia. If you use your browser's built-in sync features, browser-level settings may apply, but Marginalia itself does not initiate external network requests.
- **Cookies:** The extension does not use cookies.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to third parties because we do not have access to it.

- **No Third-Party Trackers:** The extension does not include any third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.
- **No External APIs:** The extension does not communicate with external web services.

## Permissions Justification

Marginalia requires specific permissions to function correctly. We request only the minimum necessary permissions required by standard WebExtension APIs:

- **Storage (`storage`):** Required to save your notes locally on your device.
- **Side Panel (`sidePanel` or `sidebarAction`):** Required to display the user interface in the browser's side panel or sidebar.
- **Context Menus (`contextMenus` or `menus`):** Optional. Allows you to create a note by right-clicking on a page.
- **Tabs / Active Tab:** The extension accesses the URL of the currently active tab only to determine the scope of the note you are viewing or creating. It does not continuously track or store your browsing history.

## Remote Code

Marginalia does not use any remote code. All logic is contained within the extension package installed on your browser. This ensures that the functionality cannot be changed remotely without a formal update through your browser's extension store.

## User Control

You retain full ownership and control of your data.

- **Access:** You can view all your notes within the extension.
- **Deletion:** You can edit or delete any note at any time.
- **Uninstallation:** If you uninstall Marginalia, all local data associated with the extension (your notes) will be permanently deleted by the browser.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page. Since the extension does not collect contact information, we encourage users to review this policy periodically.
